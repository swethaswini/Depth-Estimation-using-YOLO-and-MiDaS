# **YOLOv8 + MiDaS 3D Object Detection and Depth Estimation**

This project integrates **YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once)** for **OBJECT DETECTION** with **MiDaS (Monocular Depth Estimation)** for **DEPTH ESTIMATION**. The integration allows for **REAL-TIME DETECTION** and estimation of **3D BOUNDING BOXES** around objects in a live webcam feed. The model identifies objects, calculates their depth, and renders **3D CUBES** around the objects.

## **PROJECT OVERVIEW**

**YOLOv8**: A **DEEP LEARNING-BASED OBJECT DETECTION MODEL** that identifies and classifies objects within an image or video. It also outputs the **BOUNDING BOX COORDINATES** of the detected objects.

**MiDaS**: A **MONOCULAR DEPTH ESTIMATION MODEL** that generates a **DEPTH MAP** from a single RGB image. It predicts the depth of every pixel in the image, which allows us to estimate the **Z-COORDINATE** (depth) of objects detected by YOLOv8.

### **INTEGRATION**

This project combines the strengths of **YOLOv8** and **MiDaS**. YOLOv8 detects objects and provides the **X** and **Y COORDINATES**, while MiDaS provides the **Z COORDINATE (DEPTH)**. Together, they allow for the generation of **3D BOUNDING BOXES** in the **REAL-TIME WEBCAM FEED**.

## **FILES OVERVIEW**

### **1. YOLOv8 OBJECT DETECTION**
This file implements **YOLOv8** to perform **OBJECT DETECTION** on live webcam feeds. It uses the **ultralytics** library to load the **YOLOv8 MODEL** and outputs the **BOUNDING BOX COORDINATES** of detected objects along with their **CLASS LABELS** and **CONFIDENCE SCORES**. The result is drawn on the webcam feed.

#### **KEY FEATURES:**
- **REAL-TIME OBJECT DETECTION** using **YOLOv8**.
- Displays **OBJECT CLASS**, **BOUNDING BOX COORDINATES (X, Y)**, and **CONFIDENCE SCORE**.
- Support for multiple **OBJECT CLASSES** (like **PERSON**, **CAR**, etc.).

#### **DEPENDENCIES:**
- **ultralytics (YOLOv8 model)**, **torch**, **cv2**, **numpy**

### **2. MiDaS DEPTH ESTIMATION**
This file uses the **MiDaS MODEL** for **MONOCULAR DEPTH ESTIMATION**. It captures depth information of the objects detected by YOLOv8, which is used to calculate their **Z-COORDINATE (DEPTH)**. The **DEPTH MAP** generated by MiDaS is visualized alongside the original webcam feed to show the **DEPTH ESTIMATION** for each pixel in the scene.

#### **KEY FEATURES:**
- **DEPTH ESTIMATION** from a single **RGB IMAGE**.
- **REAL-TIME DEPTH MAP VISUALIZATION** using **cv2**.
- **COLOR-CODED DEPTH MAP** visualization to indicate varying distances.

#### **DEPENDENCIES:**
- **cv2**, **numpy**

### **3. YOLOv8 + MiDaS INTEGRATION (3D OBJECT DETECTION)**
This file integrates both **YOLOv8** and **MiDaS** for **REAL-TIME 3D OBJECT DETECTION**. YOLOv8 detects objects and provides the **X** and **Y COORDINATES**, while MiDaS provides the **Z COORDINATE (DEPTH)** to calculate the depth of each detected object. The final result shows **3D BOUNDING BOXES (CUBOIDS)** drawn around the detected objects in the live webcam feed.

#### **KEY FEATURES:**
- **3D OBJECT DETECTION**: Combines **YOLOv8's OBJECT DETECTION** with **MiDaS' DEPTH ESTIMATION**.
- **REAL-TIME GENERATION OF 3D CUBOIDS** around objects based on depth information.
- **CONFIDENCE SCORE** displayed in the range of **0 to 1** for each object.
- **DEPTH MAP** shown alongside the webcam feed for a better understanding of object distances.

#### **DEPENDENCIES:**
- **torch**, **cv2**, **numpy**

## **EXAMPLE OUTPUT**
- **YOLOv8 OUTPUT**: Detected objects (e.g., **PERSON**, **CAR**, etc.) with their **BOUNDING BOXES**.
- **MiDaS DEPTH MAP**: Visualized depth map where different colors represent different depths.
- **3D CUBOIDS**: The detected objects will have **3D BOUNDING BOXES (CUBOIDS)** drawn around them, reflecting their position and depth in **3D SPACE**.

## **ADDITIONAL NOTES:**
1. **DEPTH ESTIMATION**: MiDaS provides depth for every pixel, but the accuracy is better when objects are closer to the camera.
2. **3D BOUNDING BOX PRECISION**: The 3D cuboids' size and position depend on the accuracy of both **YOLOv8's BOUNDING BOXES** and **MiDaS' DEPTH ESTIMATION**.

## **FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:**
1. **OPTIMIZATION**: Optimizing the **FRAME RATE** for real-time performance with both **YOLOv8** and **MiDaS**.
2. **MULTI-OBJECT HANDLING**: Improving how the system handles overlapping objects by enhancing **3D BOUNDING BOX** precision.
3. **ADDITIONAL FEATURES**: Adding **OBJECT TRACKING** to maintain **3D CUBOIDS** around moving objects.
