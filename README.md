YOLOv8 + MiDaS 3D Object Detection and Depth Estimation
This project integrates YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) for object detection with MiDaS (Monocular Depth Estimation) for depth estimation. The integration allows for real-time detection and estimation of 3D bounding boxes around objects in a live webcam feed. The model identifies objects, calculates their depth, and renders 3D cubes around the objects.

Project Overview
YOLOv8: A deep learning-based object detection model that identifies and classifies objects within an image or video. It also outputs the bounding box coordinates of the detected objects.

MiDaS: A monocular depth estimation model that generates a depth map from a single RGB image. It predicts the depth of every pixel in the image, which allows us to estimate the Z-coordinate (depth) of objects detected by YOLOv8.

Integration
This project combines the strengths of YOLOv8 and MiDaS. YOLOv8 detects objects and provides the X and Y coordinates, while MiDaS provides the Z coordinate (depth). Together, they allow for the generation of 3D bounding boxes in the real-time webcam feed.

Files Overview
1. YOLOv8 Object Detection
This file implements YOLOv8 to perform object detection on live webcam feeds. It uses the ultralytics library to load the YOLOv8 model and outputs the bounding box coordinates of detected objects along with their class labels and confidence scores. The result is drawn on the webcam feed.

Key Features:
Real-time object detection using YOLOv8.

Displays object class, bounding box coordinates (X, Y), and confidence score.

Support for multiple object classes (like person, car, etc.).

Dependencies:
ultralytics (YOLOv8 model), torch, cv2, numpy

2. MiDaS Depth Estimation
This file uses the MiDaS model for monocular depth estimation. It captures depth information of the objects detected by YOLOv8, which is used to calculate their Z-coordinate (depth). The depth map generated by MiDaS is visualized alongside the original webcam feed to show the depth estimation for each pixel in the scene.

Key Features:
Depth estimation from a single RGB image.

Real-time depth map visualization using cv2.

Color-coded depth map visualization to indicate varying distances.

Dependencies:
cv2, numpy

3. YOLOv8 + MiDaS Integration (3D Object Detection)
This file integrates both YOLOv8 and MiDaS for real-time 3D object detection. YOLOv8 detects objects and provides the X and Y coordinates, while MiDaS provides the Z coordinate (depth) to calculate the depth of each detected object. The final result shows 3D bounding boxes (cuboids) drawn around the detected objects in the live webcam feed.

Key Features:
3D Object Detection: Combines YOLOv8's object detection with MiDaS' depth estimation.

Real-time generation of 3D cuboids around objects based on depth information.

Confidence score displayed in the range of 0 to 1 for each object.

Depth map shown alongside the webcam feed for a better understanding of object distances.

Dependencies:
torch, cv2, numpy

Example Output
YOLOv8 Output: Detected objects (e.g., person, car, etc.) with their bounding boxes.

MiDaS Depth Map: Visualized depth map where different colors represent different depths.

3D Cuboids: The detected objects will have 3D bounding boxes (cuboids) drawn around them, reflecting their position and depth in 3D space.

Additional Notes:
Depth Estimation: MiDaS provides depth for every pixel, but the accuracy is better when objects are closer to the camera.

3D Bounding Box Precision: The 3D cuboids' size and position depend on the accuracy of both YOLOv8's bounding boxes and MiDaS' depth estimation.

Future Enhancements:
Optimization: Optimizing the frame rate for real-time performance with both YOLOv8 and MiDaS.

Multi-object Handling: Improving how the system handles overlapping objects by enhancing 3D bounding box precision.

Additional Features: Adding object tracking to maintain 3D cuboids around moving objects.
